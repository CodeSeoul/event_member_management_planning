# Use Cases
This document describes key use cases of the event member management system. Note that this should be a highly dynamic document, as we will continuously add use cases as the system matures.

## Personas
This section describes the personas that will be used throughout the use cases.

### Anonymous Student
Sejong is a college student studying computer science who is conscious about his privacy. Sejong wants to learn more programming by going to events, but he's suspicious of "free" organizations and abuse of his personal data.

### Career Changer
Suzy is a marketing professional that wants to become a data scientist. She knows databases are important and has seen data scientists' reports, but she's never written any code. She has a strong statistics background and a technical mind, but she has only basic computer knowledge.

### Role Changer
Jiyoung is a mid-level frontend engineer. She's very knowledgeable in Javascript and has used some NodeJS as part of her frontend development, but she doesn't know infrastructure or the more advanced aspects of server development.

### New Instructor
June is a senior backend engineer and has volunteered to help with events at CodeSeoul. He's very capable technically, but he has limited experience in teaching groups. He sees teaching as a way to improve his skills as a senior engineer and build his network. He doesn't have time or interest in scheduling events and logistics.

### Organizer
Beth is an organizer with CodeSeoul. She's an engineering manager and sometimes runs events directly, but her concerns are focused more on posting events easily and checking events' performance to see what types of events to prepare next. She's always on the lookout for frequent attendees that could become instructors or organizers.
